I'm a data scientist based in Berlin, Germany. In a past life, I was a learning sciences researcher (PhD), which means I combined theories from psychology and methods from computer science to understand how people learn.

In my free time, I organize coding workshops and talks for PyLadies Berlin and Women in Machine Learning and Data Science (WiMLDS) Berlin and contribute to Python open source projects.

I also really love cats 🐱, good food 🍚 🍜 🍟 and specialty coffee ☕
